We've just released `@primate/tailwind`, a package that adds Tailwind CSS to
your app.

To get started, install the package and Tailwind itself.

Create a `tailwind.config.js` file.

[s=blog/tailwind-support/tailwind-config]

Finally, activate the Tailwind Primate module.

[s=blog/tailwind-support/config]

Create a CSS file and import Tailwind.

[s=blog/tailwind-support/css]

You can now start using Tailwind utility classes in your components.
