name: Add a Python backend
---

Add Python routes with the `@primate/python` module. Write routes in Python;
Primate compiles them to WebAssembly and wires them like JS routes.

!!!
Manage your Primate Python app as you would a normal Python project. Create a
`venv` and use `requirements.txt` to manage your dependencies to get a complete
LSP experience.
