name: Add a Ruby backend
---

Add Ruby routes with the `@primate/ruby` module. Write handlers in Ruby; Primate
compiles them to WebAssembly and wires them like JS routes.

!!!
Manage your Primate Ruby app as you would a normal Ruby project. Make sure you
install dependencies into `vendor` via
`bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'`, so dass Primate can pick them
up.
